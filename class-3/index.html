    <h1>Polymorphism</h1>
    <p class="p1">Polymorphism is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. In other words, polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on multiple forms, depending on the context in which it is used.

    <h1>Encapsulation</h1>
<p class="p2">
    Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that binds together the data and the methods that manipulate that data, and keeps both safe from outside interference and misuse.

In simpler terms, encapsulation is like a container that holds data (attributes) and methods (functions) together, and controls access to them.

Key aspects of encapsulation:
</p>


<h3>Data Hiding:</h3>
    
<p>
 The data is hidden from the outside world, and can only be accessed through the methods provided.

</p>
<h3>Code Organization:</h3> 
<p>
 Encapsulation helps organize code into logical units, making it easier to maintain and modify.
</p>

<h3>Access Control:</h3>
<p>
 Encapsulation provides access control mechanisms, such as public, private, and protected access modifiers, to regulate access to the data and methods.</p>
